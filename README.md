# Adventure-Sales-Report
This report is about sales

The aim of this project was to analyze Adventure Works’ sales performance and provide insights to optimize business strategies. By creating reports on revenue by continent, top 10 customers, and revenue trends by year and quarter, the goal was to identify key revenue drivers and areas for improvement.

The analysis helps stakeholders understand customer behavior, regional performance, and seasonal trends, enabling better decision-making to boost profitability and growth. Ultimately, the project provides a clear, data-driven perspective on sales performance to support effective business planning and strategy development.
